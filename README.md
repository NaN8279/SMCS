# SMCS
This is a Minecraft classic server with build-in anti-cheat. The project is currently in Alpha stage. It is not recommended to use it in production.

# Features

Currently build-in anticheats are:

- Invalid block placement (placing a block like bedrock or placing a block too far away from your position.)
- Invalid client (this kicks users trying to use a non-vanilla client. Doesn't work with all clients.)
- Invalid movement (this moves users back to the ground when noclipping or flying.)
